<!-- Problem 1 Solution with arrays: -->

Initialize two sets of elements, Set1 and Set2.
Initialize an empty array, called distinct, to store all distinct elements.
Loop through each element in Set1, check if it is not in Set2, and add it to distinct array if it is not there already.
Loop through each element in Set2, check if it is not in Set1 and distinct array, and add it to distinct array if it is not there already.
Calculate the sum of all elements in the distinct array and return the sum as output.

function findDistinctSum(set1, set2):
    distinct = []
    sum = 0
    for element1 in set1:
        if element1 not in set2 and element1 not in distinct:
            distinct.append(element1)
    for element2 in set2:
        if element2 not in set1 and element2 not in distinct:
            distinct.append(element2)
    for element in distinct:
        sum += element
    return sum

    set1 = [3, 1, 7, 9]
set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
result = findDistinctSum(set1, set2)
print(result) # Output: 13 (distinct elements 4, 7, 2)

<!-- Problem 2 write an algorithm that fulfill the following:  -->

Algorithm using a procedure:

Procedure: dot_product(v1, v2)

Set ps = 0

For i = 1 to length(v1)
   Set ps = ps + (v1[i] * v2[i])

   End For

Return ps

End Procedure

Algorithm: determine_orthogonal_vectors(n, vectors)

For i = 1 to n
  v1 = vectors[i][1]
  v2 = vectors[i][2]
  ps = dot_product(v1, v2)
  If ps == 0 then
      Print "The vectors", v1, "and", v2, "are orthogonal."
  Else
      Print "The vectors", v1, "and", v2, "are not orthogonal."
  End If
End For



Algorithm using a function:

Function: dot_product(v1, v2)

Set ps = 0

For i = 1 to length(v1)
   Set ps = ps + (v1[i] * v2[i])
  v1 = vectors[i][1]
  v2 = vectors[i][2]
  ps = dot_product(v1, v2)
  If ps == 0 then
      Print "The vectors", v1, "and", v2, "are orthogonal."
  Else
      Print "The vectors", v1, "and", v2, "are not orthogonal."
  End If

  End For

Both algorithms take as input the number of pairs of vectors, n, and a list of n pairs of vectors, vectors. Each pair of vectors is represented as a list with two elements. The first element is the first vector, v1, and the second element is the second vector, v2.

The algorithm first defines a procedure or function called dot_product, which takes two vectors as input and returns their dot product. Then, for each pair of vectors in the input list, the algorithm calls the dot_product procedure or function to calculate the dot product of the two vectors. If the dot product is zero, the algorithm prints a message saying that the vectors are orthogonal. Otherwise, it prints a message saying that the vectors are not orthogonal.



 While the array can be used to represent a vector, it is important to consider the type of vector being used. For example, if the vector is sparse (i.e., contains mostly zero values), using an array may not be the most efficient data structure.

In terms of using a nested loop, this can be useful when comparing elements of two sets, as in Problem 1. However, it is important to consider the complexity of the algorithm when using nested loops, as this can lead to performance issues with larger data sets.

When passing parameters, different types of parameters can be used, such as pass by value or pass by reference. It is important to choose the appropriate parameter passing method based on the requirements of the algorithm and the data being used. For example, pass by value can be useful when working with small data sets, while pass by reference can be more efficient when working with larger data sets.

  function dot_product(v1, v2) {
    let product = 0;

        if (dot_product(vectors[i], vectors[j]) !== 0) {
          return false;
        }
      }
    }
    return true;
  }

  <!-- In the above solution, the dot_product function takes two arrays (vectors) as parameters and returns their dot product. The are Orthogonal function takes an array of vectors as a parameter, and it checks if any two vectors in the array are orthogonal (have a dot product of zero). It returns true if all the pairs of vectors are orthogonal, and false otherwise. The algorithm uses nested loops to iterate over all pairs of vectors and calls the dot_product function to check if they are orthogonal. -->
